<h1>Hey there! I'm Somesh ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm a Java and Python developer with a passion for backend development and building intelligent systems. I specialize in Java Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, RESTful services, microservices architecture, Spring JPA, and design patterns.

<h2>What I'm passionate about</h2>

I love creating intelligent systems that solve complex problems. I'm especially interested in how AI can be used to improve healthcare outcomes and advance scientific research.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, practicing yoga, or listening to podcasts about the latest advancements in technology and science.

<h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>

Right now, I'm working on a Java Spring Boot REST API that will revolutionize the way users access movie metadata. Leveraging my expertise in microservices architecture and RESTful services, the API will provide lightning-fast responses to movie metadata requests from other microservices.
